# Ibis_behavior
This is a project I am currently working on and it will become a chapter of my disseratation. This paper is in it's final stages and corresponding analyses will be updated and cleaned up as manuscript is finalized.  

**Paper working title:** Effects of urbanization and human-provided food on wading bird foraging, grooming, and aggregation behaviors

**Aim:** Explore how variation in urbanization and human-provided food influences white ibis behaviors relevant to transmission

**Three main questions** + corresponding Rmd files:
 1. **How do white ibis activity budgets differ between urban and natural environments?** *(Rmd = Urban Natural Comparison Analysis)* [methods = single variable comparisons + multivariate analyses]
 2. **How does provisioning frequency and flock size affect ibis behavior?**
 *(Rmd = Activity Budget Analysis)* [methods = GLMM hierarchical models]
 3. **How does food provisioning affect ibis flock density?** 
 *(Rmd = Urban foraging proximity project)* [methods = simple mean comparisons]
